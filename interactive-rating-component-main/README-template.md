## 🔄 My process

### Built with 🛠️

- Semantic and Accessible HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- JavaScript for showing the Thank You Message
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learnt to use Tailwind CSS effectively in a simple HTML project. I also learnt to use its prettier plugin formatting the ulitily classes.

Some of the tailwind css techniques I learnt are:

1. **Adding Google Fonts to config file**

I learnt how we can import a google font in the CSS file and then add it as a class in the config file under _fontFaily_ section inside _theme_.

2. **Creating Custom Uitility Classes**

I created custom classes for colors to easily style my page.

3. **Using peer and peer-checked classes**

I discovered that with peer-checked class I can style a sibling element when a particlar _peer_ is selected. I used this to style the rating numbers when a radio button was checked.

### Continued development 🚀

I want to focus more on below topics and explore some techniques to improve my developing skills.

- **Setting up dark themes with Tailwind CSS** : I will explore on how I can add dark/light theme with Tailwind CSS
